## Rules Overview

In each round, the player has the right to roll the dice until they get a 1. For each dice roll value, the player earns points in the **current score**. The current score can be added to the **Total score** by clicking **"Hold"**, and in that case, the turn passes to the next player. If a player rolls a 1, the current score is reset to initial state (0), and it's the other player's turn.

The winner is the first player who successfully holds at least 100 points.
